##  ***Example 6***

* assignment operators , increment and decrementers

_num x,y,z

x++ demonstrates same as x = x+1 also x++ is equal to x++1

general arithmetic operators
x++y demonstrates x = x+y
x--y demonstrates x = x-y
x**y demonstrates x = x*y
x//y demonstrates x = x/y

x += y demonstrates x = x+y
x -= y demonstrates x = x-y
x *= y demonstrates x = x*y

x &= y demonstrates x = x & y

in general expr1 op= expr2 demonstrates expr1 = (expr1) op (expr2) where op is any operator

while expr1 op op expr2 demonstrates expr1 = (expr1) op (expr2) where op is only arithmetic operator
